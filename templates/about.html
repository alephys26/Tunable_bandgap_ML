                    Welcome to MaxMin Frequency Predictor, your trusted destination for predicting the band gap
                    frequencies
                    of pinonic crystals. Our cutting-edge regression model accurately forecasts the maximum and minimum
                    frequencies (max1, min1, max2, min2) of these crystals, providing valuable insights into their
                    unique
                    properties.

            <p>
                We are a team of dedicated researchers and data scientists passionate about unraveling the mysteries of
                pinonic crystals. The core foundation of our platform lies in the exceptional research conducted by Dr.
                Atul Kumar
                Sharma,(<a

                whose exclusive dataset shared with us has been instrumental in training our ML model. Dr.
                Sharma's work on "Topology optimization of soft compressible phononic laminates for widening the
                mechanically tunable band gaps" (ISSN 0263-8223, <a
